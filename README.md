Guess-Number Game

In this project, the user has to guess a number between 1 and 20. At the start of the game, the user's score is set to 20. For each incorrect guess, the score will decrease by one. If the user guesses the correct number, they win the game. To help the user make more accurate guesses, hints are provided:

    If the user enters a number that is too high, the message will indicate: "The guess is too high."
    If the user enters a number that is too low, the message will indicate: "The guess is too low."
